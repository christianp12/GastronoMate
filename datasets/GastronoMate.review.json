When I was ready to cook I had lots of liquid in the bowl so decided to stir in 1 t cornstarch thinking to turn it into a sauce instead of pouring it down the drain.  I ended up with a brightly colored & appealing noodle dish.  The sauce thickened nicely.  I did stir fry 1/2 of a green pepper, 2 seeded & julienned jalapenos, a half of a carrot to add to the dish, but one really could use anything.  \r\n\r\nThis was pretty, very inexpensive, used pantry staples, & easy enough for a very quick lunch. Next time I might use half orange juice instead of all of the liquid in the can for a more pronunced orange flavor.  Good luck in the contest!",

I'm not much of a raspberry pie fan so I only had a bite myself, but I thought that with the wild berries I could have used a touch more sugar but that, I think, comes with using wild berries.  Will make again and will try it with domestic berries. Thanks!",

  "Text": "I thought these were great. I always make adjustments for myself and I never measure, so I can't say exactly how much of what I used. I did use half of a white onion, mushrooms, a lot of garlic (maybe 5-6 cloves), and I also added frozen french style green beans and a few pieces of frozen sliced squash (wasn't sure how that would go so just a sample this time). I followed steps 1-3. I used thin pork loin chops and cut off the excess fat. I then seasoned the chops with fresh cracked pepper and salt. Then, I sprinked and spread regular flour over them all. I also added more seasoning from Mr. Dash (garlic & herbs plus onion & herbs) over the chops once they were in the pan. I added the frozen veggies (after rinsing for quicker thawing) in at step 7. I did put garlic powder and garlic salt over the thawed out veggies. You do also want to make sure that the chops are not boiling in the chicken stock, but just sitting above the liquid touching it. It will cook differently if you boil them (I ALMOST made that mistake of cooking the chops under the veggies in step 7 instead of on top of veggies). I did use corn starch to thicken my sauce and let me tell you... this dish was wonderful. I served it over rice and with toasted buttered french bread. What a great recipe. Thanks.",

I'm not a huge fan of tinned beans, (especially the green ones), so next time I'd try it with fresh, steamed beans or maybe use chickpeas instead.  That's just personal preference though.  The tinned wax & green beans I found were a smaller size than the recipe called for, so I did scale back the dressing to about 1/2 and that worked out fine. The only sub I made was agave nectar instead of sugar, and only about 3 tbsp worth which was still nice and sweet.  Thanks SV, I served at a BBQ dinner last night and everyone enjoyed it!",

We didn't get any gourmet hot dogs or anything like that... plus my parents are Thai and didn't eat a lot of baked goods, but we always had plenty of cheap white bread around for us kids to make sandwiches to take to school for lunch.  So, being as frugal as they were, they would just wrap a piece of bread around a hot dog and let us have at it!  We were lukcy if there were a couple of stray packets of mustard or ketchup laying around the house to dress them up with!!!  Sometimes, when I crave a quick hot dog, I will nuke it quickly and slap it on a piece of bread... the looks my BF gave me after he saw me eating the first one was priceless!!!

  "Text": "This is a great easy meal for summertime, its lite and tasty. I did make adjustments, as my husband likes hearty meals. I doubled the rice, skipped the orzo.  Our small local grocery doesn't carry this product. I used the stock from boiling the chicken breasts, using 4 cups. I increased chicken to 4 cups (3 large breasts). I skipped the mushrooms but added 1 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots with addition of broth. After bringing mixture to a boil (adding frozen veggie cooled things down) I lowered heat to low and cooked for 20mins. I did have to increase sour cream to 1 1/2 cups.  Overall, this casserole had a nice creamy flavor. With increase of all ingredients, I used 3-4 tblsp ranch mix. I liked the ranch seasoning, it wasn't strong or overpowering. I will be making this dish again. Thanks KelBel for a recipe with minimal prep.",

All I know is he kept sneaking into th e pot to \"taste test\" as he said.  I started the soup on a Thursday so it could soak overnight and be ready for hime to take Friday evening. The guys all want thsi again thsi weekend and as I doubled the batch there is a huge container in the freezer that is going. Thank goodness I made 2 indivdual serves for the freezer so I can have a bit over the weekend as well.  Kathy we loved loved this soup!  For the pasta is used small shells but I think any pasta that is small would work great.  I may add in more garlic next time as winters here are downright frigid and the garlic staves off colds.  OH this is a super keeper and one worth more than 10 stars for us winter snow people. Thsi recipe has replaced by tried and true minestrone soup as it is easier and plain delicious!",

Also, the other reviews are correct in that the wine should be increased and the broth decreased. The person who added the cornstarch ran into the same problem I did in the end-so I also added a bit to thicken the sauce after cooking. Last, it does need some spicing up unless you like a more bland version. I added additional Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt and pepper. Next time, along with the Marsala wine I will add a little red house wine too. Anyway, what is cooking , but a big, fun experiment?",

Next I'll try pan spray.  I did try parchment paper once and that worked OK.  I also read a tip that said to leave it for 24 hours before cutting as that reduces stickyness.  It would have worked if the foil would've come off.<br/>Also-I cooked it for 1 more minute (for a total of 7) and was sure the butter was melted ahead of time so all incorperated well.  I dipped some in dark chocolate which was tasty!<br/><br/>NEW NOTE- I have doubled this recipe (which used a whole can of Sweetened condensed) and cooked for 12 minutes with great success.  When I do that I use a 9x13\" pan.  I found that using parchment paper works great! I use a small smear of butter/margarine in the corners as this keeps it down and so I don't have to worry about it shifting as I pour.  I then leave for 24 hours on the counter as this seems to cut down on the stickiness.  I cut with an oiled knife as well then dip in dark chocolate. YUM!",

  "Text": "Made as a \"pressie\" for Aus/NZ Swap #23.  This is a lovely SWEET cookie, which survived enumerable errors !  I prepared the batter as directed and baked at 350* for 22 minutes.  BEWARE -- the toothpick may NEVER come clean, due to the melted white chocolate and eggs - but my hot oven did well at 20-21 minutes.  Since the recipe printed on 2 pages, I proceeded with beating the cream cheese, sugar, and zest, while the white chocolate melted.  THEN - I lost it !  Instead of adding 1/2 of melted chocolate, I dumped in the WHOLE THING !!!  I frosted the pan of blondies, THEN reread the instructions !  Sprinkled the chopped craisins, and stored in the frig.  Truly -- they survived as a very tasty cookie/bar, and will be added to my gift plates.  To be totally honest -- I sliced the unfrosted bars from the first effort and stored them in a plastic container.  They are very tasty on their own (I cut off the burned edges first.)  Kind of like the TollHouse Blondies, which are really good on their own.  Thanks for posting, Syd -- AND for being so prompt to answer my question !",

I could have sworn I had onion soup mix in the pantry (don't you always have it in the pantry?) but needless to say when I went to grab it, it could not be found.

  "Text": "I've been craving cheesecake so was happy to find this recipe submitted for the contest. The directions could have been better, like in step 7, I assume it meant melted white chocolate and vanilla. I used cinnamon graham crackers and contreau for the orange liqueur. I used the crystallized ginger but wish I hadn't, it gave a slightly moldy flavor to the bites that had it...luckily there wasn't very much of it. I made the topping but didn't really like it with the cheesecake...I added the other half of the orange zest to it because the directions didn't say what to do with them...I also had to add another 1/2 cup sugar to it when it was done because it was very sour/bitter tasting...3 cups cranberries was a whole package for me. It's hard for me to rate this because I only liked half of it but the contest ingredients were split between the two. I also don't think you could taste most of the contest ingredients white chocolate, nutmeg and ground ginger. And the dried cranberries were unnecessary to the topping. The cheesecake was very nice though, it had a good crust, a nice orange cheesecake flavor, was tall and firm and visually appealing.",

  "Text": "Tasty, versatile and easy recipe.  I made various iterations and had never made granola bars before.  The picture I&#039;ll try to attach used Quinoa, dried cranberries, semi-chocolate chips, the sweetened condensed milk and sunflower seeds as per the recipe.  For the cup of nuts I used a mixture of mostly ground cashews, slivered almonds, pumpkin seeds and a few more sunflower seeds.  I don&#039;t like commercial gluten free granola bars, but these were popular with me and my kids (including the one who usually wouldn&#039;t eat any kind of berry and is generally pickier).  Thanks for this super recipe!",

I used one 10-3/4 ounce can of tomato soup which I purchased from Aldi's. I much prefer their tomato soup over Campbell's. Aldi's tomato soup is rich in color and in taste. I only added 2 tablespoons of water, plus a 1/2 teaspoon of Morton's Season-All Seasoned Salt, sprinkled in some black pepper, and added several dashes of Tabasco sauce. We topped our sloppy joes with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese. And since I only added 2 tablespoons of the water, I found I only needed to simmer the bbq's for just 25 minutes. Len, thank you for sharing this recipe with fellow Zaar members. I look forward to making these sloppy joes often, as this recipe is definitely a keeper!!",

Since I didn't have pre-cooked chicken, I put 3/4 lb. of chicken tenders (1 lb. would have been fine, too) in the 13x9 baking dish with the chopped onions, salt and pepper  and poultry seasoning and poured some 98% fat free chicken broth over it to cover the bottom of the dish. Bake it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or until just cooked through. Remove chicken/onion mixture and chop. Pour out leftover broth and continue with recipe in same dish. Also, 15 minutes was not long enough for the corn muffin base, as it was still mushy in the middle. Bake until a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. I also doubled the red pepper and used sharp cheddar for some of the mexican cheese mix for more flavor. Next time I may add some black beans to the chicken mixture. Yum!!",

But the roast itself was very dry, despite still having plenty of liquid.  I think after 7 1/2 hours on low, the nearly four-pound roast was just plain overdone.  I recommend a much shorter slow-cooking time.  When I try this again (I think I will) I&#039;ll check it after 4 hours.",

I added garlic and leek to the vegetables because I love the blend of flavours from garlic, leeks and onions; and I used an egg rather than egg substitute, which I've never used. In step two, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to add some wine, so used half (white) wine and half water.  In adding the sage, I used a rosemary and sage blend I have in a mini grinder: a great flavour combination.  Our chops were ready in 6 hours and just SO delicious and SO tender.  This is a crock pot recipe I'll certainly be making again.  Thank you for sharing it, MsSally!  Made for Everyday is a Holiday.",

My family likes it this way. The only thing I will change is the orange. I didn't like the pieces in this dish. I think it was because it was warm. I plan to try mandarin orange slices and just regular orange juice to see if we like it better. I served this with Jasmine rice and my husband liked chow mein noodles over the top.

I think anyone could simply adjust the spices in this based on what you prefer in your pumpkin pies, and it will come out great! I appreciate the fact that this isn't an overly sweet cheesecake. The almonds are a nice touch, except that mine got wet! Note to self: Buy heavy duty, wide roll aluminum foil! Three overlapped layers of the regular weight foil on a regular sized roll just didn't keep the water out! Thanks for posting! Made for PRMR. Oops! I almost forgot!

It seems that maple syrup really adds that extra something to a sauce, as opposed to honey or sugar! We thought the sauce could have done with even a little more mustard and maple syrup (for more sweetness), but I did not want to tweak a contest recipe. \r\n\r\nI used fresh, finely chopped sage, and thought the amount given was just right. The cook forgot to mention pepper in her ingredient list, but that's just a side comment. I had really nice pork chops for this, which I deboned myself -- boneless chops are hard to find in my neck of the woods ... I made rice, a few steamed vegetables, and a salad to go with this recipe. Great, we enjoyed it very much! Maybe not yet 5 stars, but the ingredients were imaginatively used! Thanks and good luck, chef!",

I drizzled a small amount of olive oil in place of the margarine for some moisture in the cake, and made the sauce to recipe but substituted the margarine for Soy milk. It didn&#039;t thicken (naturally) as much as a standard caramel sauce but I got it up to boil then off the heat which made it did thicken enough to become a sticky &amp; luscious sauce. I did pour it over cake to help with any dryness and it was perfect!!  Thank you for such a great recipe, I&#039;ll be showing this off and noone will ever suspect it&#039;s vegan!",

This recipe can definitely be halved for the smaller brunches, and the glaze is highly optional. For a twist, add a bit of orange extract (just a bit!) or dried orange peel to the filling- the hint of orange is very tasty!",

The smoked paprika and saffron take this recipe to another taste level; whilst the red pepper ranch dressing adds a subtle and exciting flavour, and none of the above ingredients overpower the flavour of the burger. I am a HUGE lover of caramelised onions, and they are wonderful with this spicy burger. I served this with fried potatoes and fresh tomatoes from the garden. I did not have kaiser rolls, so I used my home-made French Boule bread - sliced and lightly toasted. I made this for Beyond Burgers in the Photos Forum, and also for the Gardening, Herbs and Spices Forum - Herb/Spice of the month - PAPRIKA! I used smoked paprika in this recipe for a subtle smoky flavour. Amazing Shadows - a burger beyond any burger I have ever tasted - wonderful! Oh yes, I used mature Cheddar cheese.",

  "Text": "These are great! Followed the recipe as is..but uhmm 1/2 red pepper flakes= 2 pcs of it right? :D It's a bit spicy sweet but it's expected of Szechwan.  It's after it's cooked that it tasted so hot,  but after I waited for an hour the spiciness mellowed down a bit which is way good for me. Usually if it's so spicy, my DH would not touch it at all, but even if it is, he still finished this so that really says something. I also liked your suggestion on how to present it.  So colorful and looks so appetizing.  Thanks for for an easy but great recipe, carolinajewel!  (Reviewed this for Chinese New Year tag game) :)",

I used brown sugar, and sprinkled an extra couple tbsps of it over the berries before pouring in the batter. I served it plain- it didn't need a thing with it! I used blackberries and raspberries, and I went ahead and spread them ALL on the bottom of the cake pan- I didn't think they would stick as a post-baking topping. Only word of warning is- don't put in birthday candles while the cake is still hot! They melted into it. :)",

I used homemade squash puree I had in the freezer from last fall. The puree had more moisture in it than canned pumpkin would have and so I ended up adding a couple extra cups of flour to get the consistancy right. The only I might do different next time is to let them rise the 2nd time for maybe 45 mins to an hour to make them a bit lighter. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe Happy Harry #2.",

I did add some dried basil since I ran out of fresh.  I had a little less than 1/4 c. of fresh, and about 1 tsp of dried.  It was very fresh and comforting.  I swear, fresh mozzarella really makes a difference in flavor compared to pre-shredded.  Thank you for posting this awesome recipe!",

  "Text": "All I ever eat at ESM is Hell's Kitchen Chicken. This recipe calls for a few things that are not part of the original recipe ESM dredges the chicken in flour and fries it in the pan to add a bit of a GBD (Golden Brown Delicious) coating. Also, they do not top the dish with Mozzarella, the server comes to the table with a block of Parmesan Cheese to grate over the dish if you like. Other than that, I can't see why this recipe wouldn't be very close to ESM's dish. I plan to make it very soon and will post my results",

Where I did have difficulty was that I couldn't seem to get the rice evenly cooked.. some grains were still gritty and not cooked though enough, whilst the rest was starting to stick and burn on the bottom of the pot.  For me this needs some refining to solve that problem becuase even though the heat was very low and I added more milk to save it, it still had a little too much crunch in the end. I added honey on the top, but didn't have any pistacho nuts to hand so skipped those. Please see my Rating System: 3 stars for a recipe that I was delighted to have tried, but which needs some working on to get the perfect smooth and creamy texture I'm looking for. Thanks!",

  "Text": "10 Stars!  What a decadent recipe, it's so wicked that I think I need to become a Catholic and go to Confession!  I used something called marshmallow fluff ( very new in supermarkets here) and added in some extra chopped marshmallows, (they melted in the warm chocolate)and just used block  \"puur\" chocolate broken into bits for the correct quantity of chocolate. I did make a few small errors that were totally mine and not the recipes: I obviously didn''t butter my dish well enough because I had a devil of a time getting it out of the pan ( I will experiment with lining a dish with foil for next time) and I did use a deeper pan, a shallow one is definiately to be recommended. Also I rather roughly chopped my apricots, next time I will finely chop them so that they get better distributed around the fudge and the pieces don't break up so much around the big lumps of apricot. Taste: a total total winner ! This is smooth chocolateness at it's best, not cloyingly sweet and the apricots give an interesting balance to the decadent chocolate. Sadly the nutritional information might seem to be incorrect? : only 75 calories per serving??  with all that sugar and chololate? even if it would be... in the end it's not,  ...all my Sint Nicolas guests were going back for fourths !  \r\nIn the end if you are pushing the boat out  for a treat then deep water is not to be worried about: go for the pure indulgence ! This is in my humble opinion a restuarant quality recipe that my family are already asking to see again.  Please see my Rating System:  I think that I should just slip this onto the table during my next Staff Evaluation meeting with my boss LOL ... 5 brilliantly excellent stars for one of the best recipes I have found on Zaar so far. Thanks Syd!",

The 4 cups of chicken broth seemed like way too much - the sauce was the consistency of water - way too runny for what I'd like.  Next time we're going to cut the broth down to 2 cups to make a thicker sauce.  Other than that, we loved it!  My 5 year old even liked it.  We will definitely try this again.  Also, we used Penzey's \"Vindaloo\" Seasoning instead of traditional curry powder.  Just the right amount of mild spiciness.",

I can also see this sauce easily used for other meats, like Nyteglori mentioned pork or even steak, etc. I used Smuckers No Sugar Added orange marmalade and it worked great!  Thanks for a very easy main course chicken dish!",

I also add a can of regular milk plus 1/2 T cornstarch or another can of coconut milk.  I use 4 T fish sauce.  Zest from 4 limes is a good sub for kaffir lime leaves.  And lastly I don't use galangal.  I mix up the veggies I use, decreasing potatoes and adding carrots and a red or yellow pepper.  The recipe is quite versatile.  <br/><br/>Try it, you'll love it... you may look for my recipe if you don't want to try to make these changes.",

I took piece of flat lavash bread (whole wheat) used red potatoes and acorn squash which I just microwaved, some smoked cheddar cheese. Heat it it the oven for about 5 minutes until it browned up, and topped it with some heirloom tomatoes. I was bringing it to a friends because they provide the drinks and I provide snacks, so I rolled it up and cut it into pieces. Everyone loved even though they were highly doubtful when I said acorn squash. Two people even asked me to come over there house and cook for them. I do want to try this recipe as intended soon though. Nice fall flavors.",

The potato was diced and added to the sausage, a small amount of water was added and in less than 5 minutes both the sausage and potatoes were cooked through.  The eggs were poured over all making this a quick one dish breakfast.  Made for ZWTIII.  Thanks Vicki!",

I was expecting wilty spinach. So I left the foil on and baked an additional 15 minutes. The spinach still wasn't as wilted as I was expecting, but it was okay. (I added sliced garlic to the top of the spinach before baking because I love spinach and garlic together.) So maybe next time I will cook the spinach a little bit on the stove top to give it a head start. That kind of ruins the simplicity that I loved about this recipe, but oh well. My husband doesn't really like tomatoes and usually picks them off the dishes I make, but he absolutely loved them in this recipe (and ate so many he got heartburn!) Overall, a good recipe that I would recommend trying.",

This was so quick and easy to make but wonderful combination from the crunch of the graham cracker, the the sweet  creamy/chewy toffee and then again the crunch from the pecans.  Will definitely add some of these for the xmas cookie tray.  Thanks for sharing FolkDiva!!  Made for photo tag!!",

I do agree they&#039;re not super sweet, but w/ the jam in the center, I think more sugar would be over-kill! I have made these a few times &amp; have been learning how to make the hole &amp; put the jam in there. I didn&#039;t do the heart shaped option since I was focusing so much on making the recipe work! I used a tbsp measuring spoon to &quot;dig&quot; the hole &amp; found that making it wide AND deep would hold the jam well, w/o it spilling over (which was a problem for me at first. And I used about 1 tsp of sugar free strawberry preserves). I thought 400 was a bit high (they baked rather fast; 8 min) so I tried 350 for about 10-12 min, which worked better. A little powdered sugar dusting helps if you have a sweeter tooth. Thanks so much for sharing!",

My dough was pretty sticky after it came together in the bread maker so I added another 1/2 cup of white flour. I also added 3 tbsp. of wheat gluten. My bread also took a long time to rise... about 1 1/2 hours. I should have let it go for 2. I'd probably use white bread flour next time instead of the all-purpose but the recipe is great as is.

Such a great recipe! ______ I make this every other week, occasionally modifying it here and there. This week I added a summer squash, for example, and a whole bunch of extra kale. When I don't have barley, I've used farro, pearled couscous or whatever other grain-type I have in the cabinet. I also love spices, so I go super-heavy on the italian spices - basil, thyme, oregano, parsley, etc. I've been doing this for months and have yet to tire of it! It makes about 8 2 cup servings. I portion them and stick them in the freezer. It is healthy, hearty and perfect for lunches!",

I used half the water (as some of the reviewers did) and was happy with the texture (I like a thick dressing so I thought they extra calories would be worth it). I didn't have honey on hand but used some corn syrup instead (since I also love sweet dressings  I did use a bit more). I liked the addition of Worcestershire, too. This resulted in a nice dressing and I really didn't miss the extra oil/sugar in the end. Thanks Diana, for another great recipe.\nRoxygirl",

Sorry.\n\nThe cream cheese was ok being lower in fat because it was mixed with powdered sugar and vanilla\n\nMy biggest concern was the frying.  I tried it. But to me I would of rather had it just pan sauteed with butter.  I kept tasting oil. I just didn't like the fried taste.\n\nBut the sauce and filling and cinnamon bread was a great flavor.

Plated and served topped with sun dried tomatoes, fresh mint from the garden, salt, pepper and lemon wedges. For each serving we spooned a little bit of Nancy's whole milk plain yogurt. Went well with pan grilled lamb chops (Salish salt and black pepper that was it). I'm sure the beans taste wonderful braised but there just wasn't enough time to do that. Next time!

This recipe was very easy to follow and well-written, it describes and guides you through every step in a friendly and precise way. This was my first batch of hard boiled eggs (EVER) and I was surprised to see that they were a perfect, soft yellow at the center and firm white on the outside. Perfect recipe, thanks!",

I know I enjoyed it on this cooler Spring day.  For the record, as I was running low on fresh Parm, I tried my second helping with fresh pecorino romano cheese on top and this worked well too.  While it took awhile for everything to cook, I did not think the soup was difficult to make.  I&#039;m looking forward to sharing it with DH for leftover lunch tomorrow.  Thanks!

However, I never attempted enchiladas before and refused to use the can sauce.  I don't know if someone could help me w/what I may have done wrong.  By the other reviews, it was probably just my lack of enchilada knowledge.  But the sauce was WAY to thick for me.  Nothing I did made it thinner.  I tried adding more broth and when I ran out of broth I tried water.  Nothing worked!  And I do like the sauce thick, but this was to where I had to spread it with a spoon and it was extremely hard to dip the tortillas.  I also felt it had virtually no flavor and tried adding additional spices with still not achieving the flavor I was looking for.  I even tried cocoa which was a suggested Mexican secret with many recipes.  Like I said, it was probably just me.  But my excitement moved to discouragement.  I think I will have to keep looking.  :(",

Personally I loved the saffron taste.\n\nI did make a couple changes.  Since we don't eat pork, I used some turkey hot italian sausage links and I cooked the paella completely on the stove top because I had bread baking in the oven.  \n\nI don't like bell peppers but since the red would look nice and I know my husband likes them, I put them in.  They really added a nice taste and I'm glad I used them (but if you tell anyone I said that about bell peppers, I'll deny it.)\n\nThis is definitely a keeper.",

The sauces are surprisingly mild, but then I cut the jalepeno to not use the tip or white parts inside. The last time I tried store bought salsa verde to save time, but this time I made the recipe and was much much improved.  We have found that you must serve the cakes piping hot. If they start to cool down (which happens on a cool plate in cool sauces), the cake loses its punch. The hot/cool is about as important as the sweet/spicy, creamy crunchy. Instead of 4 cakes, I make 6 smaller cakes and there is still too much southwestern sauce and salsa verde. You could easily double the cake and tomato salsa portions to get 8.  Make 50% more salsa verde for 12 cakes.  \r\n\r\nI hadn't seen the review to do it on the stove, and it didn't brown up enough on parchment paper, so the pictures I posted w/ black specs is from a blowtorch to get color/crunch.",

Those that tried a cupcake LOVED it - but the dates were scaring people away - who knew people were afraid of dates??  LOL!!  I didn't have any problem getting these to cook through.  I did get 30 large cupcakes out of the batter.  My kitchen scale is broken (okay, I dropped it on the floor & wrecked it) so I used 2 cups of icing sugar in the frosting & was very pleased with the results.  I generously frosted all 30 of my cupcakes & probably had enough frosting left over to do another dozen or so.",

The dressing was spicy & sweet, the salad was soft & crunchy and every bite was exciting to the taste buds. My biggest compliment would be the seasoning made for the chicken. Every element of this recipe had a place and no one ingredient overpowered any other. My only change was becuase I had no idea what was meant by \"barbecue seasoning\" so I used Old Bay Seasoning in it's place. Since half the family can't eat cheese I didn't serve it but I did serve the salad with tortilla chips and sour cream. Afterall, what is TACO salad without those two as garnish? Thanks for sharing your creation! Made for RSC Lucky #13.  UPDATE:  We've made this recipe again several times & will again tonight.  It's an excellent way to get the kids to eat all those good veggies & beans without them realizing it.  :)",

At great personal risk, I made and enjoyed a second drink, using powdered sugar, which was less frozen than the first drink.  Fortunately I was already home for the night.  The lime juice accented the strawberry, but also requires some sugar to prevent a too sour daquiri.  I was still able to count up to 5 when pulling out more warehouse club giant frozen strawberries for the second drink, so I appreciated the simple directions.  Without rum, it wouldn't be a daquiri.  The Chambord liqueur helped to reinforce the strawberry and add some sweetness, but ah, Chambord is delightful on its own as well.  A web check revealed that Triple Sec (orange) is used more often than Chambord.  I will make this drink again, and will use the Chambord again as well.  Thanks for posting, appleydapply!

Next time I think I will lower the sugar down to 2 tablespoons and maybe use applesauce instead of the oil. I made it the first time and it flopped. I used wheat flour and forgot to put the oil in it. It was really dense but not too bad with the wheat flour. This one I decided to try the white flour and work it from there.",

My chops were a little on the thick side (about 1\") and I cooked them about 8 mins. on each side, and they came out a little pink in the middle.  The key to them being perfect is to make sure you check them often so they don't get too well done, as they will burn if left unattended.    I marinated for about 6 hrs. and the flavors were infused nicely in the meat.  Thanks!",

I used Jiffy baking mix and it worked just as well.  I omitted the mushrooms due to personal taste.  I used an entire 6 cups of broth so I would have to save 3/4 of a cup.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  My only future change may be to try some different seasonings in it.  But it was great as is.  Thanks again, I will definitely make in the future!

If your family likes stuffed cabbage rolls (and you shudder at the thought of boiling uncooperative cabbage leaves then rolling and stuffing for half an hour - then this is your recipe!  I made it as is, with a bit more tomato sauce.  Next time, I&#039;ll stir some cooked rice (about 1 cup or less) into the ground beef mixture - then it will become a deconstructed cabbage roll.  Serve with mashed potatoes and you&#039;ve got a winter winner on your hands!

I ended up adding some additional herbs and a bit of red pepper. If your family prefers sauced pastas, this probably won't work. I liked it quite well, but will probably have to make it again when it's only me for dinner. I think adding some sliced spinach to this would work very well.",

I admit I did not read the ingredients very well, I thought this was for baking the whole chicken, and so when I realized that I had to cut the chicken up, I tried my best but pretty much mangled it. Still it did not affect the taste at all. I went a little easy on the saffron since it is so expensive and such a treat in our house. Also instead of using cinnamon sticks, I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I kept everything else the same, only I turned the heat low and let it simmer (covered) for about 3 hours. This made the chicken turn out so tender & juicy. I made plain rice and spooned the accumulated juices over top of the rice. I definately plan to keep this recipe for making on special occasions, we really enjoyed it.",

The first pan was wonderful but the 2nd one was too dry on top and not so good leftover.  I&#039;ve never been good at guessing measurements and I probably didn&#039;t leave enough sauce for the top of the enchiladas.  I probably spread too much sauce in the bottom of the pan......I would recommend a very thin layer for anyone trying it out.  I left out the jalapenos but did use some pepperjack cheese in the dish.  I would highly recommend this dish but next time I&#039;ll just make one recipe.  Thanks for posting.  Made for Football Pool 2013.",

We used it in wraps and on crackers and it dripped fishy lime juice down our arms. I don't know what would improve that or if we ought to have been eating it with spoons instead of on wraps.\n\nI used a mix of red and yellow tomatoes and it made a really beautiful dish.\n\nNote -- be careful of the onion. Not all red onions are mild and sweet. I had to cut back a bit to keep the flavors in balance.",

I love the flavors and agree with another reviewer, the taste ends up somewhere between a BBQ sauce and a sweet and sour sauce. I personally throw all of the sauce ingredients (including the pineapple) into the Magic Bullet and blend it all up into a smooth sauce. It just makes it super easy, and is nice if you're not a fan of chunks. Highly recommend this recipe! Yum.",

I have also tried the original recipe this was modified from, & thought that was tasty as well, but this dish blows that dish away, if I may be so bold.   It smells delicious even before you put the dish in the oven, and the skin wasn't burnt, but crisped to perfection (some people, like my husband, get grossed out by the skin, but if you're with me you'll understand!).  The meat was also falling off the bone & moist.  My husband loved this recipe and gave an eager thumbs up when I asked if I should keep this recipe in our menu.  Thank you PSU Lioness!",

You HAVE to use the Golden Mushroom Soup, not cream of, or it will not taste the same.  I also put in at least 1/2 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms since they cook down and shrink.  The cream cheese gives this a decadent creamy flavor and the sauce is to die for!  This is super easy and I have even made it on the stove top with slices of sirloin steak when I was in a hurry. Still comes out great!  I would have never thought to use the golden mushroom soup with cream cheese had I not found this recipe and I am SO glad I did!

  "Text": "Made for ZWT-8 Family Picks, your recipe attracted me because I love Tex-Mex food & using my crockpot for it. I read the somewhat mixed reviews & made the recipe using med-sized (but sturdy) pasta shells & crisped the bacon as suggested by 2 reviewers. I do think black olives &/or grd meat would be excellent adds for those so inclined or when a greater amt is needed to serve family or guests. While I love the combo of flavours & see this as Mexican \"comfort food\", I do feel the advantage of using a crockpot is lost on this recipe. I found myself wishing I could cook the pasta, assemble the ingredients in a casserole dish & pop it into the oven to get all bubbly B4 serving. A compromise might be to make the recipe on the stove-top & transfer it to the crockpot to keep warm for direct service. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. -- Edited to Add: If the use of the crockpot was a contest requirement, then you might consider revising the cooking method of this recipe. :)",

As our steaks were smaller we put them in a lower oven temperature (mine and the DS going in a little later so we had medium rare and the DH had well done.)

I do concur with chef twissis that it's a good idea to warm the honey brown sugar mixture. It was cold enough in my kitchen that the meat just pushed the mixture around without any of it sticking. A quick microwave visit of 40 seconds solved that. Served with rice (cooked with about 1/2 t of the sesame oil), and orange pepper oven roasted in olive oil and light seasoning (Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute, if you must know). Also, while not sickeningly sweet, this was still tasty enough to satisfy a sweet tooth--didn't feel like I needed any dessert after. Definitely intend to repeat this meal!",

I exchanged the red wine vinegar for much less cider vinegar with the mother in it because wine vinegar is derived from wine. I used the larger amount of sweet paprika but maybe hot paprika should be used in this. I used some minced fresh cooking onion as I didnt have any onion powder. I used extra virgin olive oil, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. For the stuffing I used cooked white Basmati rice, 1/2 tsp tahini instead of sesame seeds, fresh baby spinach, no sugar as it never said when to add it so I didn't relise until later. Instead of dill, as I didn't have any and thyme I just used an Italian seasoning which includes thyme but I can see dill would be good here. I had to use fresh mint so I used less as I thought it would be a stronger flavour than dried but I didnt taste it coming through in the result. I wont make this again because I didnt like the flavour of the chicken legs though the marinade does taste pretty good. Also it is too much trouble for the result I had.",

The Frangelico flavor really shines through in this drink, and the milk provides a creamy texture to round it off. While heating the milk, I was thinking this might be perfect using Almond Milk instead of regular whole milk, but now I wonder if the nutty taste might be overwhelming. I will make this drink again (many times) exactly as the recipe is written, but I will venture off the path at some point and try Almond Milk. What a great discovery. Thank you for a GREAT drink recipe, Baby Kato. This is going on my &quot;Best of 2017&quot; list immediately.",

I will be making this again to have with my cheese stuffed shells and will be making as directed. I think I would have given this a 5 star rating if I had left it alone. I regretted the add ins once sauce was simmering a while and I saw where it was going, but too late I a had already added stuff. I will review again after I make the stuffed shells. This was wonderful to make, even though I had to make it after work. Few ingredients, and able to pretty much able to just let simmer while other things got done. I just wish I had left alone, and had been able to truly enjoy the flavors as they should have been. But I will be making this again most definetly",

I cooked my taters' on top of my wood-stove - slowly - first boiling them as the author suggests, then putting them in a pan and cooking them with the rest of the ingredients. I quickly seared the salmon - then put that atop the lovely golden potatoes- and it was just heavenly! This is truly a more then 5 star recipe - so easy with all the taste you could and can imagine! Great for company, and easier the pouring a glass of warm milk before bedtime. Enjoy life, enjoy food, and enjoy your friends!",

I added a little taco seasoning and some garlic powder and cumin to season the soup and a couple pinches of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Don't substitute anything for the fire-roasted tomatoes! They make a huge difference! And don't skimp on the toppings! Cheddar cheese, green onion, avocado, sour cream, tortilla chips..yum!

If you're not watching sodium, you can add it at the table with great results.  One thing I wish is that the pie crust had the size with it.  Mine, I think, was too big for the amount of filling.

I highly suggest adding cheddar cheese to this recipe, it really makes it a 4 star recipe after doing so. I'm still a huge fan of Ree and her recipes. :)",

  "Text": "This was excellent, moist and tender and very flavorful! My loin was around 2lbs, no fat needed trimming. It was a section I cut from 6 lob loin I bought at Costco, and though the other recipe I made for the other part was good this was so much better. One thing I think that made a difference, is that I browned the meat in olive oil in my cast iron frying pan before spreading on  the peanut butter mix. The searing of the meat helped to keep in the juices and made it much moister and added to the flavor. I drained off the oil after broning and roasted the meat in the frying pan. I warmed the p'nut butter and soy a little which helped to incorporate them better - just 15 secs in the microwave. I couldn't find pineapple perserves so I mixed 1/2 cup of peach jam with about 4 oz of drained crushed pineapple, because of the size or my pork loin I knew it would take longer to cook, so I just waited till it reach 150 degrees before spreading on the jam mix. It's hard to describe how wonderful the flavor combination of this dish is. The p'nut butter isn't over powering but it's there. The fruit mix is lucious slightly sweet but savory with the pork juices, and the red pepper gives it a subltle  warmth. The only thing I might change is the name of the recipe - I think the peanut butter in the title might scare some people from trying it : )  I think I found the first entry in my \"Top 20 for 2008\" cookbook,   thanks Nimz for sharing.",

I used dried marjoram and basil, and then added some fresh thyme sprigs to the slow cooker liquid for extra flavor.  I also used the balsamic vinegar.  It smelled heavenly when cooking, which took 6 hours.  The beef was super tender.  I found that the vinegar really overpowered the other flavors, however.  I think, perhaps, if I thickened the remaining juices and made a gravy, it would have been nice.  I did serve this with horseradish mashed potatoes, as suggested, which complemented it nicely.

I followed directions with 3 lbs of brisket and really just guessed on proportions of other ingredients.  Cooked for 24 hours and was a little dry and did not really taste the flavor.  Added the extra ingredients and cooked for an hour.  It might have been my proportions but not quite enough sauce.  However after 1 hour meat was still a little dry but flavor was awesome.  Put on buns with slaw and some pickles, I added a little extra bottled bbq sauce on mine.   It was delicious and my son said just as good as the Dickey's Westerner sandwich (a local bbq shop we hit from time to time).  My daughter ate hers which is a big deal.  Overall it was excellent due to ease of preperation and taste.  Will definately make again and wish I had taken a picture of it for everyone to see.  I can't imagine many people are going to make 8 lbs at once so I would recommend a little larger proportions on finishing sauce.  Try it you won't be dissappointed.",

Covered and cooked until carrots/celery were tender and liquid was reduced to 1/2 cup.  Added the tomatoes to cool it down then into the blender.  Back into the pot to reheat and I added the rest of the ingredients from step 2. Then added evaporated milk since I had that open and needed to use it.  I will make this again using the heavy cream and whip some up for the topping.   I love lazyme's photo and how she says it melts into the hot soup.  Made for *1 2 3 Hit Wonders* game 2007",

I pan fried 3 minutes per side instead of using the Foreman since I had a hot skillet after toasting the onion rolls. This is a terrific turkey burger and it is much better than most beef burgers.",

  "Text": "Sat. 8/04 - I had to convince my husband to let me follow this recipe rather than making the patties from ground turkey \"straight\" which is always too dry and bland for my taste. We both were thrilled with the results. Delicious moist burgers. Yum!! I did make a small change in substituting Lawry's seasoning salt for the oregano and celery seed. I added just a shake or two of garlic powder and onion powder along with the worcestershire sauce. I used panko style crumbs and probably a little less than 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar. I recommend grilling rather than pan frying. The grill really boosts the flavor. Thanks PdxBarb!!!\r\n\r\nUpdate 8/24:  My husband could eat these turkey burgers everyday. He's really hooked on these burgers. I usually crave variety, but I agree with him. I double the recipe and make 10 burgers (3 and 3/4 ounces each) and we eat them for a few days.  They're great!",

  "Text": "I love this recipe!  It is delicious, simple, economical and filling!  It's also one of those recipes that I could imagine my mom making back in the late 60's or early 70's.   I used four, skin on \"Smart Chicken\" brand thighs for the meat and made the sauce as written.  It didn't make too much sauce for us, and I would probably double the sauce ingredients if I used two pounds of meat -- or a whole cut up chicken.  I didn't have the red wine and just used an extra half-cup of water.  I don't know that we even missed the wine flavor.  The sauce was awesome on it's own!!  After all the browning was done, I put it in a casserole, covered with foil and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and uncovered it the last 15 minutes and it was fork tender.  Next time I'll make the entire dish and freeze it in meal-size portions.  I had left-over angel hair in the freezer, so it was a very quick meal to get together.  Chef Mariajane, thank you for the wonderful recipe!  It's a keeper!",

I don't think I had a full pound of ground pork, so I lowered the amounts of salt and pepper, and used shallots because I was out of regular onions.  I used ground sage but I'll have to try it with fresh sage next time around! I was scared that maybe everyone wouldn't like the addition of the apples (my family tends to like savoury pork dishes rather than sweet) but you can't really make out that there's apple at all. It gives perhaps a hint of sweetness but also a nice texture to the meatloaf. I served this with my favourite barbecue sauce. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!",

The vegies were cooking in the second oven and we bought it all together.  Did try making a gravy from the pan juices but did not work, tasted awful to be true to fact.  The DH was not at all keen on the flavour combination but I expected that and was hoping to convert him but the DS and I loved (but I would still prefer a bit of pink there but is out voted).

  "Text": "I didn't know what size cookie sheet to use for this, so I halved the recipe & made it in my small bar cookie pan (Pampered Chef stoneware), sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  The pan still seemed too large for the recipe so I made a dam with aluminum foil halfway across the pan & patted the crumble into just half of the pan.  It was still a little thin feeling, but I know next time I'll just make the full recipe & can still use the bar cookie pan.  I don't have any cookie sheets with sides, but that would be a must with this recipe, as the syrup would run right off the edge of a flat pan.  The instructions don't say how long to cook the syrup either, so I boiled it hard & stirred for 2 minutes before pouring it over the rhubarb.  It baked for the full 60 minutes and the final result tastes wonderful!  Sweet & tart, crunchy & chewy.  It's a very beautiful dessert!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, CJAY!  Made & enjoyed for June's Photo Forum event Undercover:  Pies & Tarts.",

Even with the one ingredient missing this was a hit. We tend to like fruity savoury dishes in our household and this one will definitely be a repeat. It isn't something you want to make if you're wanting highly spiced (I DID end up putting some garlic in it for a bit of balance) and it also needs salt when finished to bring out the flavors some. But this is a mild fruity rice dish that I think would be just as good w/out the chicken and served as a side dish. Will make again. Thanks Pattikay!",

I still cooked more potatoes than we ate for this meal as I anticipated - correctly - that cooked with so many yummy ingredients that they would be enjoyed over the next few days in other dishes.  The only changes I made were to proportionally increase the garlic (as we love garlic) and to use part Recipe #135453 and part white wine instead of water.  On the recommendation of other reviewers I turned the potatoes when I turned the chicken so that they were well-flavoured with the amazingly delicious juices.  My chicken and potatoes were in the oven for about an hour and 10 minutes.  I followed AuntSana's superb idea for reducing the fat: a nifty trick which I'll also be using for other recipes.  Thank you, Ravenseyes, for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

Also, because the Mongolian Beef I&#039;ve had in restaurants is usually a bit spicy, I added a teaspoon or so of jarred chili-garlic sauce for a bit of heat -- perfect.

  "Text": "I loved justcallmetoni's idea of using this recipe to make kebabs, so that's what I did. I threaded the cubed chicken pieces onto wooden skewers with chunks of mushrooms, red peppers and onion and marinated the kebabs for 24 hours. The only things I omitted from the marinade were the hot sauce and the cracked pepper (personal taste preferences) but I did include several grindings of black pepper. Great marinade and the chicken was just so delicious. I panfried my kebabs which we thoroughly enjoyed with loof's Recipe #266129. Thank you for sharing another easy and delicious recipe, MsSally.

  "Text": "Move over Hamburger Helper!  Jodie's got a better alternative that's just as simple.  I loved this because it reminds me of eating goulash in college.  Somehow I wound up with twice as many noodles so I added another can of tomatoes, a bunch of bell peppers, and a lot of cheddar cheese.  I wanted a little more bite so I threw in some red pepper, then added garlic, salt,  and pepper.  I will remember this dish when I feel like going out to eat because cooking seems too time-consuming  and I'd have to go to the store to make anything.  You probably have everything you need on hand, or you could make it up based on what's in the kitchen cupboard.  If I had mushrooms, I definitely would have added them.  Very hearty and satisfying.

I loved the chocolate chips in these and know I'll be making these often as they mix up quickly and without issue and really give a final scone that is tasty and lighter in texture than most scones I've made.

It's a keeper. Thanks a million again, Kit for sharing!!! Big hugs, Glen of Coolidge, Arizona Hi again Kit, I made this for dinner last night and OOOH MY GOSH!!!! It was \"DELICIOUS.\" Very very tasty and yummy. EXCELLENT RECIPE. Good job, Kit. I'll be making this again for our guests today. I can't wait to hear what they think. Thanks a million, Kit for sharing this. Yummy, yummy!! May 15th, '07 Hi Kit, I don't know how many times i've made this recipe already but like i said it's gotten to be a weekly thing for my hubby. This one is his PERSONAL favorite. I made this again last night but i didn't use cream of chicken soup instead, I put 1 cup of GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE, i used half and half instead of milk and use more sour cream iN it. What i did was, i added chopped fresh parsley into the sauce and i used part of it as a paste on the chicken before i rolled it up. I also put some shredded mozarella on top of the paste with the cream cheese. OHHH, it was delicious. I might add, my hubby really likes cheese. he-he. I also pre-cooked the bacon 400 degrees in the oven for 15 mins. and it was perfect for the rolling. Soo, more than 10 stars for this one. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing. luvyah, Glen of Coolidge, Arizona",

This was the perfect dinner as most of family is home with cold and stuffiness. (They come to visit and are ill for vacation) Anyway this is great! For me what a time saver as it let me do a large pot of chicken soup on the stove and know dinner would be done as well. I love crockpot dinners and this ranks right up there. Made for Kittencal's Cookathon 2008. Thanks Kitten!  edited to add: used the minimal amount of leftovers, watered down the gravy a bit and threw in some additional beef broth and veggies to simmer.  Chopped up the leftover, leftovers  of beef and made a quick soup.  YUMMY!",

I made this as directed with cinnabon bread and added golden raisins. The recipe didn't say to peel the persimmons, and some people do eat the skin, so I didn't...I wish I did...the skin ended up giving the whole thing the texture of dried shredded coconut which I dislike. It didn't have much flavor and wasn't sweet enough. Sadly, we ended up throwing most of it out. If I were to make it again...I would try peeling and dicing the persimmons and adding extra brown sugar and spices.",

That temperature is definitely outside the USDA guidelines, and bacteria may be growing and multiplying quite a while.  Poultry, especially, should not be cooked at less than 325 degrees. To be safe use the same spices but increase the temperature to 325 and decrease the oven time. Allow about 20 minutes per pound for the roasting time. The safest way to determine doneness is to use a meat thermometer and make sure the final temperature, in the thigh, is the 180 degrees  stated in this recipe.",

DH and I are not wimpy in the heat and spice department, but the sauce burned our noses, making the tuna hard to eat.  If the wasabi was reduced, I think the sauce would be very good.  We skipped the daikon radishes.  I served with Recipe #225328 225328, which paired nicely as a side.",

The horseradish I used  was so strong it was the only note at first, but after chilling everything blended & was terrific.  My avocado was ripe so melded into the creamy dressing.  The crunch from the water chestnuts added a highlight too.  I think additional veggies would add color & only add to the awesome salad.  Thank you for your entry & good luck in the contest!",

I was surprised this cookie didnt call for salt but I assume its because peanut butter is a little salty and it just didnt need it. I did bake 6-7 minutes and to be honest that was too raw for me still. I think its whatever you prefer so I think I left them in there for 10 minutes. Still very soft and chewy. I froze them after baking which they freeze very nicely. Thank you!",

Next time I would probably use a little more bacon to make sure that all of the stuffing stayed in, or maybe just pile sauerkraut on top when it's done! lol. Oh - and I used Monterey Jack cheese since the only cheddar I had on hand was greated. Thanks GailAnn for a nice meal yet again. Made for Everyday is a Holiday Tag.",

I should have weighed it as the weight was not readable. It took much longer than anticipated to reach the correct temperature, about an hour longer. The stuffing that was not under the breast did get quite crispy but was still good. I am thinking that the breast may have not completely thawed prior to putting in the oven. However, the turkey meat was so wonderfully moist. This was a skin on breast which likely helped retain moisture. I did add a handful of dried cranberries into the stuffing mixture which added a nice dimension. I am going to try this with chicken pieces next. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

To save a step,while browning the beef, the onion and garlic were added.Since I'm a wimp,only one can of the green chilies were added. After reading the reviews,I used a full cup of beef broth.Other than those changes, the recipe was made as it was written.And for me cheese isn't optional, it's a requirement :). Instead of adding it to the completed recipe, each person added the desired amount to their portion. After tasting,I did have to add a bit of sour cream to mine.( read SPICY,at least to me.)When this is made again, I will cut back the chili powder to about 2 teaspoons to see if that will help reduce the spiciness.Even though it was SPICY, I really enjoyed it.

I made it for Thanksgiving and doubled the recipe thinking that the filling wouldn't be enough to fill my dish.  Wrong!!  I ended up having to make two complete desserts...this makes a lot of cream filling.  I actually liked the cream filling more before I put all the whipped cream in, so next time I will halve the whipped cream.  The cream cheese filling was nearly addictive...but I somehow managed to get it all in the dishes. lol!  I let this setup overnight and it was a huge hit, even with those who were used to *real tiramisu*.  Even my friend's nine year old son asked for the recipe so his mom could make it for him.  It was still good a few days after Thanksgiving, just keep it in the fridge.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for easy elegance and creamy decedance, then this is for you.",

Do not care for celery salt, so used Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning blend for poultry in place of that and the paprika (I think paprika adds color and nothing much else).  Took the skin off the chicken breasts.  Placed in marinade in early morning and cooked about 10 hours later.  Other than that (and a few additional crackers), lol, followed directions.  Since the chef suggested a broiler pan, we used a rack inside of a foil lined pan for ease of cleaning, which probably is what made the chicken crispy.  It was delightful in both looks and taste and smelled great while cooking.  Thanks so much for sharing this; it will be regular now in our home!",

I put the potatoes in a large bowl, poured some olive oil over them and mixed.  Then I added the herbs and salt.  Put them on the foil covered pan, smashed them add more of the herbs then topped them with about 2 teaspoons of parmesan.  These would go very well with grilled steak when summer comes around.

I did put a little more lemon and a lot more garlic in mine because of personal preference.  This was such a different dish and definitely worth a try!!!",

I just don't see how you can go wrong with that!<br/>  Also, I find it so much even better as it sits a day or two in the pan (13 x 9)soaking up the glaze completely.

Definitely didn't satisfy my craving for their mac and cheese. I don't love the flavor. It tastes a bit too mustardy for my taste, so I would definitely watch out for that. Also, with all of the cheeses that you have to buy, its a pretty expensive recipe. I think that my regular mac and cheese recipe is a lot better.",

It turned out wonderful, with the custard turning out tasty and set even though I messed with it like I did with the peaches.  By the way, with the crust and 2 cups of peaches at the bottom, it overfilled a nine-inch, deep pie pan.  I imagine that size would hold this custard amount by itself easily, if anyone wondered.

After 1 hour and 15 minutes I removed the cake from the oven and allowed it to cool, and the edges pulled away nicely and it was a snap to unmold. I served it tonight with whipped cream.

But otherwise I continued exactly as per recipe,  using parmesan cheese rather than mascarpone, although I think the mascarpone would be seriously fabulous. A creamy risotto, not sweet despite the honey, but very flavoursome. It is rich!

I used roast veggie broth that I bought at the grocery store.  THANKS for sharing!  UPDATE:  I made this again yesterday and used expensive Muir Glen crushed fire-roasted tomatoes, subbed the whipped cream for about 1/4 cup of vegan sour cream (worked perfectly) and then thew it in the blender.  Hubby thought it was too pureed, so I added in two diced fresh Roma tomatoes and it was outstanding.  This definitely made 4 nice sized bowls of soup, so 2 meals for us!

Big slices spread with butter :) Next time I'll probably try this with self rising flour or double the baking powder since they didn't rise quite as much as I'd like. I'd also like to try them with half butter/half shortening. Either way they're scrumpious!",

Husband and I are lovers of Char Siu and we think we might prepare this with that ingredient next time for an additional flavor.

So, for the ganache I used 64 and for the cupcakes I used 96 chips. Also, you can freeze these to use at a later date---that is, if there are any left!  Enjoy...we love, love, love them!",

Fortunately I only did about eight or nine eggs, I followed the recipe to the letter and found the eggs extremely difficult to peel as though the shells were super glued to the egg itself! My previous method was simply add eggs to boiling water, boil for 11 minutes drain and rinse with cold water. My my recipe made peeling the eggs child play compared to this much more complex recipe. The eggs came out so poorly I'd be embarrassed to use them with my deviled egg recipe. The only thing good is the yolks did seem to cook properly.

The dough was super easy to work with and the texture of the muffins was soft and thick, which we really enjoyed.<br/>However I cannot give the full 5 stars as I had quite some trouble baking these in my dry skillet. They stuck like crazy and I could only manage to bake through one of them this way. The others I had to scrape out of the skillet and then I just reshaped them and popped them into the oven for 25 minutes at 180°C. That worked nicely and they puffed up quite a bit. The crust wasnt as good as the one from the pan (the darker coloured pic), but all in all they were great, too.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this easy and healthy recipe with us, Kat! Ill make these again for sure!<br/>Made and reviewed for my chosen chef during Veggie Swap #31 February 2011.",

  "Text": "Like Barenaked Chef, this recipe absolutely did not work for me. At least not in the oven, and my oven's lowest temp only goes to 170 degrees, and even after 20 minutes, the chips hadn't melted at all. Luckilly I was able to resolve the melting of the chips, and melted them in my double boiler, which only took 5 minutes. Personally, If you have a double boiler, I would skip the oven method to melting the chips, as the double boiler is a much quicker way to go. I did want to add... that when I made this bark, I used a bit more of the chips to make a bit more candy. I used 2-(12 oz.) bags of Nestle's Premier White Mosels, or you could use 1 (1 lb. 8 oz.) bag, plus I used a bit larger size jelly roll-type pan (mine was, 17-1/4\" x 11-1/4\" x 3/4\"). I didn't use an entire cup of the cinnamon candies, I just sprinkled on desired amount. I also placed the pan in the freezer for 5 minutes to quickly firm up the bark, and the cinnamon hearts didn't get dull nor tacky as another reviewer had stated. I also made the semi-sweet chocolate version, and it took 15 minutes to set up in the freezer, and after you touch the chocolate, it immediately melts onto your fingers and makes a chocolate mess, plus I didn't care for it taste-wise. I like the white chocolate best, and will stick to making that from now on. For Easter, I plan on using this recipe to make Jelly Bean Bark, and for Halloween, I'll make Candy Corn Bark, and for C'mas, I'll use crushed candy canes to make Peppermint Bark. I bet this would also taste great with dried cranberries and Pistachio nuts. If I were to rate this recipe as written, I would only give it 1-star, but since I was able remedy the melting of the chips, I decided to give this recipe 5-stars. It's the only recipe I will use to make white-chocolate-bark candy. Thanks for sharing this recipe mamacancook!!",

This dish did not disappoint in the flavor department. The sauce really made this meal and married fantastically with the grilled steak. I do not eat red meat but made the steak for dh who loved it as well. I used my portion of the sauce to top a grilled chicken breast and I thought it was terrific. The potatoes are of course a no brainer with steak but to add the mascarpone was new for us and a fantastic addition. I will definitely be making them that way again. Maybe next time with some garlic? mmmm The sauce was fast and easy- of course I  used frozen cherries as the fresh were past their peak. That little bit of help made the sauce go even faster. Reduced perfectly in the time specified. This whole recipe looked time consuming and maybe difficult because of all the ingredients yet went remarkable quickly and easily.I only had time to submit one recipe and was required to make one, so I perused all of them and chose this one as \"if I only have time to make one recipe this is the one!' recipe to make. Glad that I did. Best of luck chef!",

Sometimes I have been on a yeast/mold free diet and some forms of rennent and culturing is not allowed for that. I saw the review by gemini08 about the milk and but others seemed to have it work. I tried to find not Ultra-pasteurized and was surprised at how prevalent it was. I found some organic milk and didn&#039;t see until it was too late that it WAS ultra. Tried it anyways and only ended up with lemony milk. Tried again, this time found milk that was pasteurized but not homogenized so pretty close to the original. I added fresh squeezed lemon. Overnight I couldn&#039;t tell if anything was happening so added more lemon. Next day decided to try it, it seemed sour but not curdled at all. Raised temp as directed and no curds were formed. It also didn&#039;t taste sour after all so it must not have don the right thing in the beginning. I contacted the chef who said she uses pasteurized milk. Either my lemon wasn&#039;t strong enough or I didn&#039;t cook it long enough at the right temperature. Someday I may try again.",

It was well-received & I am pleased to have struck another blow in the fight against *naked salads* in Iceland.

I even second guess the notion of putting it in a beef stroganoff rather than have a stand alone as a wonderful starter to a class email.fast forward, it was the very best beef stroganoff I have ever made! I plan on making it again and again using this recipe as a base. I also plan on using this recipe to serve the soup as a stand-alone starter for a nice meal.

I had to remove the casing from my chorizo, so it was more of a crumbled texture rather than coins, but I think I prefer it this way. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the 3rd tsp of salt - and honestly I think I could have omitted all of it - and I also added about a cup of chicken broth to make it a little saucier as we like it.

  "Text": "Seriously delicious! Used 3 big zester strips of lemon rind (no white pith) which I then skinnied into 4 strips apiece. Used rather more broth (closer to a cup & a half so had to increase cornstarch to 1 1/2 t. Came together fast after prepping shrimp (shells in leftover chicken broth, olive oil & butter on the back burner now for stock). Added 2 T lemon juice at the end.  Served with steamed brown rice - yum. Wonderful recipe! This is a keeper in our house! Thank you so much for posting Cookin-jo!",

  "Text": "Fabulous!!  My kids said they are the best I have tried from different recipes here.  I actually tripled the recipe as I was using them to send in with DD for her HS Art Class breakfast and she came back with not one left!!  Good thing I kept 6 here or there would have been some issues.  I did goof and melted all the chopped chocolate with the butter (I really should read better!) and then added some semi-sweet chocolate chunks to the batter at the end.  They were really full of chocolate flavor because of my goof but it did not affect the texture at all.  I'll be making these often - the kids would have an uprise if I did not promise this!  Truly a terrific find in 123 Hits tag game.",

I served this with recipe#433645 &amp; they went wonderfully together.  This would be equally excellent as a dessert topping.  Quick &amp; easy.  Definitely a keeper!
